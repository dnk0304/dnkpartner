/**
 * Post-signin splash transition with cross-fade handoff to the dashboard.
 *
 * Goal: after a successful sign-in (or register-then-sign-in), show a brief
 * full-screen splash with the DNK Partner logo before navigating to the
 * post-login surface — and crucially, cross-fade the splash AWAY over the
 * next route so it reveals underneath rather than slamming into view.
 *
 * Timing (~3700ms total — fade-out tripled per Dennis QA 2026-05-26):
 *   0-250ms      Phase 1: splash fades IN over the auth form
 *                (cc-splash-fade-in keyframe).
 *   80-430ms     Banner + subtitle lift up (cc-splash-rise, overlapping
 *                with phase 1's fade-in so the entrance feels coordinated).
 *   250-1300ms   Phase 2: splash holds at full opacity (~1050ms of stillness).
 *                The eye reads the banner. The brain registers "launching".
 *   1300ms       HANDOFF: we clone the splash DOM into document.body as a
 *                detached node, then fire onDone() which calls router.push().
 *                The React splash unmounts (its owner page navigates away),
 *                but the clone is now a free-standing DOM element that the
 *                React tree no longer controls.
 *   1300-3700ms  Phase 3: the cloned splash fades from opacity 1 -> 0 over
 *                2400ms ease-out via a CSS transition. The dashboard, rendered
 *                underneath, becomes progressively visible.
 *   3700ms       transitionend fires; the clone removes itself from the DOM.
 *
 * Why the DOM clone? React-managed nodes inside the auth page unmount the
 * moment router.push() resolves the new route. To make the splash survive
 * across the route boundary we hand it off to plain DOM — outside React's
 * reconciler — so it can continue its fade-out independently while the new
 * route mounts beneath it. The clone is pointer-events:none so the user can
 * interact with the dashboard immediately, even during the fade.
 *
 * Reduced-motion: users who set prefers-reduced-motion: reduce skip the
 * entire splash. We fire onDone() synchronously on mount — no overlay, no
 * delay, no cross-fade. They get straight to the dashboard.
 *
 * The banner uses `priority` so if it was preloaded by the blurred backdrop
 * on the previous step (login page), it's an instant paint from cache.
 *
 * Render strategy: position:fixed/z-50 overlay rather than mounting a route
 * — no extra navigation, no router latency, no flicker between auth card
 * and splash. The auth page mounts the splash on top in-place, then unmounts
 * itself when the splash hands off and navigates away.
